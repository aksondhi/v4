My first major project as a developer was to develop a ray tracing engine (commonly used for high end 3D image rendering) for a graphics course. After completing this project for the course I chose to optimize the program over a cluster of linux machines. This was achieved by balancing the rendering load through multithreading and stitching of the final image. This optimization resulted in a 30x performance improvement.
