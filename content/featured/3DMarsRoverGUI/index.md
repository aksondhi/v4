Used an iRobot equipped with an IR and sonar sensor to develop a program that navigates a course. The objective was to navigate the robot to be within all the goal posts. I used my new knowledge of embedded systems to communicate with the rover via Bluetooth as well as developed the GUI using jMonkeyEngine.I added features using a MySQL database and the Java Swing libraries to allow a
Teaching Assistant to view any rover and group's current status and view their progress both live as well as fly through
their course.
